# Debug plugin for AttractMode front end

by [Keil Miller Jr](http://keilmillerjr.com)

## DESCRIPTION:

Debug plugin is for the [AttractMode](http://attractmode.org) front end. It can reload the layout with a user definable key press.

You may also want to check out the [Debug module](https://github.com/keilmillerjr/debug-module).

## Paths

You may need to change file paths as necessary as each platform (windows, mac, linux) has a slightly different directory structure.

## Install Files

1. Copy plugin files to `$HOME/.attract/plugins/Debug/`.

## Usage

You can enable the Debug plugin by running Attract Mode and pressing the tab key to enter the configure menu. Navigate to `Plug-ins -> Debug -> Enabled`. Enable the plugin and set the **Reload Layout Key** to a custom key. Pressing this custom key you set up will reload the layout. A suggestion is to use the letter "R". This aids in the design process because you no longer have to kill and restart the attract app.

## Notes

More functionality is expected as it meets my needs. If you have an idea of something to add that might benefit a wide range of layout developers, please join the AttractMode forum and send me a message.
